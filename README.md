## Objective
Having a fit and healthy body is everyone's dream, but it has somehow not been everyone's cup of tea. Between 2017 and 2018, the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey observes 1 out of every 4 children are suffering from Obesity, also obesity is linked to more than 60 chronic diseases and there is epidemic of obesity around the world.

In the U.S, childhood obesity alone is estimated to cost $14 billion annually in direct health expenses. Unhealthy lifestyle and eating habits has direct impact on physical health causing damage to metabolism, which has impact on mental well-being too. Most part of the problem comes from a lack of awareness of what people are eating and how much energy they burn every day.

WalkTracker is a digital technology to help people eat better, get fitter and lose weight. The primary solution is delivered via a smartphone app (iOS, Android) with a team of qualified diet/ fitness expert’s available in-app. It also allows optional integration with various tracking wearables. The funds would be used in developing AI and ML interface, so that it can service more users with fitness suggestions, healthy alternative food and task recommendations.

Our app will help users to track their health and wellness progress using step count. Also, will be providing points based on the steps count. The rewarded points can be used to buy products like Our University T-Shirts,Caps.
